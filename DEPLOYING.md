# Deploying to Heroku

## Prerequisites

If you haven't yet done so, [sign up for a Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/) and [install the Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install), and make sure you can login and list your applications.

```sh
heroku login # just a one-time thing when you use heroku for the first time

heroku apps # at this time, results might be empty-ish
```

## Server Setup

> IMPORTANT: run the following commands from the root directory of your repository!

Use the online [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) or the command-line (instructions below) to [create a new application server](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app), specifying a unique name (e.g. "trivia-app-123", but yours will need to be different):

```sh
heroku create trivia-app-123 # choose your own unique name!
```

Verify the app has been created:

```sh
heroku apps
```

Also verify this step has associated the local repo with a remote address called "heroku":

```sh
git remote -v
```

## Server Configuration

Before we copy the source code to the remote server, we need to configure the server's environment in a similar way we configured our local environment.

Instead of using a ".env" file, we will directly configure the server's environment variables by either clicking "Reveal Config Vars" from the "Settings" tab in your application's Heroku dashboard, or from the command line (instructions below):

```sh
# or, alternatively...

# get environment variables:
heroku config # at this time, results might be empty-ish

# set environment variables:
heroku config:set APP_ENV="production"

#this code should be included in your heroku config var if you decide to have user form
#heroku config:set CATEGORY="General Knowledge"

```

At this point, you should be able to verify the production environment has been configured with the proper environment variable values:

```sh
heroku config
```

## Deploying

After this configuration process is complete, you are finally ready to "deploy" the application's source code to the Heroku server:

```sh
git push heroku main
```

> NOTE: any time you update your source code, you can repeat this deployment command to upload your new code onto the server

## Running the Script in Production

Once you've deployed the source code to the Heroku server, login to the server to see the files there, and take an opportunity to test your ability to run the script that now lives on the server:

```sh
heroku run bash # login to the server
# ... whoami # see that you are not on your local computer anymore
# ... ls -al # optionally see the files, nice!
# ... python -m app.daily_briefing # see the output, nice!
# ... exit # logout

# or alternatively, run it from your computer, in "detached" mode:
heroku run "python -m app.trivia_game"
```

## Go play your trivia game with your friends!
